# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in C++ using console window.

## Description

This project is a simple console-based Snake game implemented in C++ . The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's own body.

The project demonstrates the use of basic C++ concepts, such as classes, data structures, input handling, and game logic. It utilizes the Windows API functions for console input and output.
